        id (int): Primary key. Unique identifier for the employee record.
        first_name (str): Employee's first name. Indexed for faster search
         operations.

         operations.
        title (str): Job title or designation of the employee
        (e.g., 'Software Engineer').
        organisation (str): Name of the organization the employee belongs to.
        employee_number (int): Unique number assigned to the employee. Must be
         unique across records and is indexed.
        role (str): Functional or security role within the system
        (e.g., 'Admin', 'User').
        email (str): Employeeâ€™s email address. Must be unique and is
        indexed for fast lookups.

    Table:
        employees: Stores employee records with unique constraints on email and
        employee_number.

    Indexes:
        - first_name
        - last_name
        - employee_number
        - email

    Unique Constraints:
        - email
        - employee_number

        employee = EmployeeDB(
            first_name="John",
            last_name="Doe",
            title="Mr",
